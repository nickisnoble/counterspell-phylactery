  # The `Views::Base` is an abstract class for all your views.

  # By default, it inherits from `Components::Base`, but you
  # can change that to `Phlex::HTML` if you want to keep views and
  # components independent.

  # Include the Components kit to make all components available
  # without the Components:: namespace prefix
